Booster shots contain the same ingredients and dosage as the previous doses (except for Moderna where half the dosage is administered for a booster). Boosters are recommended because immunity from previous doses decreases over time and so booster doses can provide a better immune response by reintroducing more antibodies. The booster dose helps increase protection against new variants as well but not as effectively as older variants. Adults older than 30 years can take either mRNA vaccine as their booster does regardless of their previous doses. The Pfizer vaccine is preferred for those between the ages of 12 and 29.
